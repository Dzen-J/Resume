I do most of my work in the direction of Data sciense/ML, hence the knowledge of classical ML algorithms (Scikit-learn / XGBoost / CatBoost) and how they work, I also have the ability to use DL to solve problems (Pytorch, ResNet, YOLO), I can visualize data using mathplotlib and seaborn, work with data using Pandas and NumPy. I feel confident in the field of mathematics, namely linear algebra, probability theory and mathematical statistics. I also have experience in writing simple SQLite and MySQL database queries. I can park something on Beautiful Soup. Now I am developing in the direction of Computer vision, I use OpenCV, ResNet, YOLO, I am also fond of low-level CV like ROS and modeling in Gasebo, hence I have experience working in Linux.
